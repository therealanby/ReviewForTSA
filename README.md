# ReviewForTSA
Reviewing some stuff for TSA code competition

Review:
HashMap
HashSet
Stack
Queue
Inorder (recursive + iterative)
Preorder (recursive + iterative)
Postorder (recursive + iterative)
Levelorder (recursive + iterative)

Quicksort (just in case i get to a weird sorting problem)
Mergesort 

- OrderedMap/LinkedHashMap (problem with hashmap is that it's unordered, so learning this is good)

Test cases #resources
